In today's digital landscape, public Wi-Fi networks are widely used but often lack proper
encryption, making them vulnerable to cyber attacks. One of the most dangerous and commonly
exploited threats is the Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, where an attacker intercepts
communication between two parties without their knowledge. This poses a significant risk to
users accessing sensitive information, such as login credentials, over unsecured networks.
The objective of this project is to simulate a MITM attack in a controlled lab environment to
demonstrate how attackers can intercept unencrypted HTTP traffic and retrieve sensitive data
from unsuspecting users. By using tools such as Ettercap, arpspoof, and Wireshark, this
simulation aims to highlight the risks associated with insecure public Wi-Fi networks and
emphasize the importance of secure web protocols (HTTPS), VPNs, and user awareness as
countermeasures.
